# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a repo for the rock-paper-scissor module.

## Development Container _(optional)_

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

-   For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
    -   If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/D7017E/Rock-Paper-Scissors) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.
-   For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
